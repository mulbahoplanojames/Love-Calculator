# Love Calculator JavaScript Project

A simple web application that calculates the love percentage between two people. This project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

The Love Calculator project consists of a single HTML file, a CSS file (output.css), and a JavaScript file (main.js). The web page allows users to enter their names and their partner's name, and then calculates and displays the love percentage between them.

## Usage

2. Enter your name in the "Your name" input field.
3. Enter your partner's name in the "Partner's name" input field.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to see the love percentage result.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `output.css`: The stylesheet file for styling the web page.
- `main.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the love percentage calculation and updates the result.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to run the Love Calculator.
